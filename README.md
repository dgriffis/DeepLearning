Style Transfer
As an example of the kind of things you'll be building with deep learning models, here is a really fun project, fast style transfer. Style transfer allows you to take famous paintings, and recreate your own images in their styles! The network learns the underlying techniques of those paintings and figures out how to apply them on its own. This model was trained on the styles of famous paintings and is able to transfer those styles to other images and even videos!
